## Learning Goals
* The project spec & rubric can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/niche-audience.html)
  * Demonstrate mastery of:
    * React
    * Router
    * Async JS
    * End-to-end testing via Cypress  
  * Utilizing personas & user stories to empathize with our chosen niche
  * Solving a unique problem for a niche audience with limited time
  * Meet the following core functionality requirements:
    * Utilize an API to display data in a way that makes sense for the audience
    * Ability to store/manipulate data displayed in the app
    * Using React Router to handle mutliple views

## Reflections / Lessons Learned
* Spending time on wireframing + planning how components interact goes a long way
* When on a time crunch: focus on an MVP and build out additional features if time allows
* Learned a lot about empathizing with the user through personas & user stories

## Possible Future Extensions
* Class + level selection to filter appropriate spells
* Better reset/recharge spell functionality
* More options for each spell card, including what spells do at higher levels
